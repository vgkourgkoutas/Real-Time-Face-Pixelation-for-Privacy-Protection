# Real-Time-Face-Pixelation-for-Privacy-Protection

This project implements a real-time face anonymization system using
deep learning-based face detection and pixelation techniques.
The goal is to protect user identity in images and live video streams,
with a focus on privacy-preserving computer vision applications.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Traditional face detection methods often fail when faces are rotated or partially occluded.
To address this limitation, this project uses a deep learning-based face detector
(OpenCV DNN with an SSD architecture) combined with pixelation-based anonymization.

The system detects faces in real time and applies pixelation to prevent identity recognition,
while maintaining stable performance in live video streams.
